# 2021_Data-Wrangling-Earthquakes
## [Python|Web scraping|pandas|git|R]

This project was done during the course "Databases and Analytics Programming". The main goal was to build a database from scratch, mainly using web scraping techniques. In particular, I create a dataset of all the registers of Earthquakes available in Wikipedia. Once the data was collected, I coded a completed programme for cleaning the data set and making it available for analysis. Finally, in the report is possible to find all the critical steps in the process and Exploratory Analysis of the data.

**Abstract**—The paper aims to explore how Earthquakes can affect the trajectory of the countries’ economic development over the years. The database was built using the scrapping technique and programming language to process, clean, and analyse the data. In conclusion, the paper shows how something like natural disaster does not exist, instead of experiencing natural phenom- ena with bad human management of these conditions.
