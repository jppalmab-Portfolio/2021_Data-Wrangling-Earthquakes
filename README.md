# 2021_Data-Wrangling-Earthquakes
`[Python | Web scraping | pandas | git | R]`

Welcome to the "Data Wrangling - Earthquakes" repository! This project was completed during the course "Databases and Analytics Programming" and focuses on building a comprehensive database of earthquake records from various reliable sources. By utilizing web scraping techniques and employing programming languages like Python, we have created a dataset containing detailed information on earthquakes. The repository includes the necessary code, documentation, and analysis to understand and explore the collected earthquake data.

## Repository Contents:
1. Code: Python scripts for web scraping, data cleaning, and analysis, showcasing the step-by-step process of building the earthquake database.
1. Data: The dataset consisting of earthquake records collected from reliable sources, providing valuable insights into the occurrence and characteristics of earthquakes.
1. Documentation: A comprehensive report highlighting the critical steps involved in the data wrangling process, along with an exploratory analysis of the earthquake dataset.

**Abstract:**

The aim of this project is to explore the impact of earthquakes on the economic development trajectory of countries over the years. By constructing a robust earthquake database using web scraping techniques and leveraging programming languages, we have gathered, processed, and cleaned the earthquake data for analysis. The report included in this repository presents the critical steps involved in the data wrangling process, showcasing how natural phenomena like earthquakes can profoundly affect societies, economies, and development. It emphasizes the significance of proper human management and response to mitigate the consequences of such events.
